             <p style="color:yellow"> Pubg is a battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, 
		is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. 
		In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed 
		themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. 
		The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. This is the first game in the series, named PUBG Universe.</p>
